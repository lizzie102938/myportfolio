              <p>Before entering the World of Tech, I worked in sales and marketing for global spirits companies, Pernod Ricard and RÃ©my Cointreau. I learned to code because I wanted a new challenge that felt creative and meaningful. Using my tech skills and prior business experience, I look to create user experiences that shape modern society. I enjoy working in teams of interesting people and love the collaborative nature of the developer community.</p>
